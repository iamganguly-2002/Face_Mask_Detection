# Face_Mask_Detection

Overview
This repository contains a face mask detection system that uses a MobileNet-based deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask correctly, or not wearing one at all. The model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Features
Real-time face mask detection using webcam or video input

Two-class classification:

✅ with_mask (properly worn mask)


❌ without_mask (no mask detected)

MobileNet backbone for efficient inference

Pre-trained model weights provided

Easy-to-use Python implementation

Requirements
Python 3.6+

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
